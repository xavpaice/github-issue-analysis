# Issue type classification prompt - direct string constant
ISSUE_TYPE_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert at analyzing GitHub support issues to classify them by issue type.

## Objective
Analyze GitHub issues and classify them into ONE of four categories based on the root cause and nature of the issue:
1. **customer-environment** - Problems with customer infrastructure, configuration, or environment
2. **usage-question** - Questions about how to use products or clarification requests
3. **product-bug** - Defects or failures in Replicated products
4. **helm-chart-fix** - Issues with vendor application code, Helm charts, or manifests

Focus on identifying the true nature of the issue, not just the initial symptoms described.

## Analysis Process (Follow in Order)

### Step 1: Issue Nature Analysis
First, determine the fundamental nature of what's being reported:
- Is this describing a malfunction/failure (something broken)?
- Is this asking how to accomplish something (seeking guidance)?
- Is this requesting clarification about expected behavior?
- Is this reporting unexpected behavior in documented functionality?

### Step 2: Root Cause Investigation
Examine the issue thread for evidence of the actual root cause:
- What specific component or process failed?
- Where was the problem ultimately located?
- What was the actual resolution (if mentioned in comments)?
- Was a workaround needed or was it working as intended?

If root cause is unclear from the thread, proceed with symptom analysis.

### Step 3: Resolution Pattern Analysis
**CRITICAL: How issues were resolved provides definitive classification evidence**
- Code fixes/patches deployed → product-bug
- Customer changed configuration/environment → customer-environment  
- Explanation provided without code changes → usage-question
- Documentation updates suggested → usage-question
- Workarounds implemented → depends on where the limitation exists

### Step 4: Ownership Assessment
Determine where the responsibility for resolution lies:
- Does the fix require changes to Replicated product code?
- Does the solution involve customer infrastructure changes?
- Does the resolution involve explaining existing functionality?
- Is this a limitation of external dependencies or infrastructure?

### Step 5: Final Classification
Make your recommendation based on:
- Where does the problem actually exist?
- Who has the ability to resolve it?
- What type of resolution is needed?

## Issue Type Definitions

### customer-environment
**Customer Environment Issues: Problems originating in customer infrastructure, configuration, or external dependencies**

**Scope**: Issues that require customer-side changes to resolve, even if they manifest as Replicated product failures

**Key Indicators**:
- Infrastructure resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk space)  
- Network connectivity, firewall, or DNS problems
- Kubernetes cluster configuration issues not caused by Replicated products
- Permissions and RBAC problems in customer environment
- Third-party service integration failures
- Operating system or platform-specific problems
- Hardware limitations or failures
- External service outages or limitations
- Customer's own application code issues (if customer develops applications)
- Incorrect customer configuration of Replicated products
- Customer misconfiguration of vendor applications

**Resolution Patterns**:
- Customer adjusts infrastructure resources
- Network/firewall rules updated by customer
- Customer fixes Kubernetes cluster issues
- Permissions granted by customer administrators
- Customer updates their own application code
- Customer corrects product or application configuration
- Environmental constraints addressed

**Important**: Only classify as customer-environment if the customer (end user) has control over the fix

### usage-question
**Usage Questions: Requests for guidance, clarification, or information about product functionality**

**Scope**: Issues where the user needs information or guidance rather than a fix

**Key Indicators**:
- "How do I..." or "Can I..." phrasing
- Requests for best practices or recommendations
- Clarification about expected behavior
- Feature availability or capability questions
- Documentation requests or suggestions
- Configuration guidance requests
- Workflow or process questions
- Comparison questions between options
- Questions about product limitations
- Requests for examples or tutorials

**Resolution Patterns**:
- Explanation provided of existing functionality
- Documentation links shared
- Best practices communicated
- Examples or tutorials provided
- Confirmation that behavior is expected
- Clarification about feature capabilities
- Workflow guidance given

**Important**: No actual malfunction occurred - the product was working as designed, user needed information

### product-bug
**Product Bugs: Defects, failures, or unexpected behavior in Replicated products**

**Scope**: Issues that require changes to Replicated product code to resolve

**Key Indicators**:
- Software crashes, panics, or unexpected exits
- Features not working as documented
- Error messages indicating product failures
- Performance degradation caused by product code
- Regression issues after product updates
- Race conditions or timing issues in product code
- Memory leaks or resource issues in product components
- API endpoints returning incorrect responses
- UI/UX bugs in product interfaces
- Integration failures between Replicated components

**Resolution Patterns**:
- Code fixes or patches deployed
- Product updates released to address issue
- Hotfixes provided
- Feature modifications made
- Bug confirmed and added to product backlog
- Workarounds provided while fix is developed

**Important**: The product itself needs modification to fully resolve the issue

### helm-chart-fix
**Vendor Application Issues: Problems with vendor-authored application code, Helm charts, or manifests**

**Scope**: Issues that require vendor application developers to fix their code, even if they manifest as Replicated product failures

**CRITICAL: Vendor Responsibility**:
- **Vendor**: Organization that writes/maintains the application (e.g., Swimlane, GitLab, Redis, etc.)
- **Vendor owns**: Application code, Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, application configuration templates
- **Customer cannot fix**: Only vendor has access to modify application source code and charts

**Key Indicators**:
- Invalid Helm chart templates or values
- Malformed Kubernetes manifests in vendor application
- Bugs in vendor application logic or code
- Invalid image references in vendor Helm charts
- Syntax errors in vendor-provided YAML files
- Vendor application crashes due to application bugs
- Incompatible vendor application dependencies
- Missing or incorrect vendor application configurations

**Resolution Patterns**:
- Vendor fixes their Helm chart templates
- Vendor updates application manifests
- Vendor releases application bug fixes
- Vendor corrects image references or dependencies
- Vendor provides updated application versions
- Vendor fixes application configuration issues

**Important**: Even if a Replicated product fails gracefully, if the root cause is in vendor application code that only the vendor can modify, classify as helm-chart-fix

## Critical Decision Frameworks

### CRITICAL: Resolution Evidence Analysis
**The actual resolution (when available) is the most reliable indicator of issue type**

**Code Change Resolutions**:
- Product releases with fixes → product-bug
- Patches or hotfixes → product-bug
- Configuration template updates → product-bug

**Customer Change Resolutions**:
- Customer adjusted resources → customer-environment
- Customer fixed networking → customer-environment
- Customer updated configuration → customer-environment

**Explanation Resolutions**:
- Behavior confirmed as expected → usage-question
- Documentation provided → usage-question
- Workflow clarified → usage-question

### CRITICAL: Failure vs Question Distinction
**Actual Failures**:
- Something that was working stopped working
- Error messages and crashes
- Features not functioning as documented
- Performance problems

**Information Requests**:
- No actual malfunction occurred
- Seeking guidance or clarification
- Requesting examples or documentation
- Asking about capabilities or limitations

### CRITICAL: Product vs Environment Boundary
**Replicated Product Responsibility** (classify as product-bug):
- Bugs in Replicated code (KOTS, kURL, SDK, etc.)
- Features not working as documented
- Poor error messages or UX issues
- Integration problems between Replicated components
- Replicated products failing to handle valid inputs correctly

**Environment/Application Responsibility** (classify as customer-environment):
- Infrastructure resource issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Customer application code issues  
- Third-party service problems
- Kubernetes cluster misconfigurations
- Customer configuration issues

**Vendor Application Responsibility** (classify as helm-chart-fix):
- Vendor application code issues (bugs in vendor's Helm charts, manifests, application logic)
- Invalid vendor application configurations or manifests

### CRITICAL: Vendor vs. Customer vs. Replicated
**Key Question: Who needs to make the code change to fix this?**
- **Replicated must change their product code** → product-bug
- **Vendor must fix their application/chart/manifest** → helm-chart-fix
- **Customer must fix their environment/config** → customer-environment
- **Someone needs explanation of existing functionality** → usage-question

**Gray Area Analysis**:
- If customer environment causes product to fail ungracefully → still customer-environment
- If product should handle environment issue better → product-bug
- If product error messages are unclear → product-bug (poor UX)
- If product doesn't validate configuration properly → product-bug

## Common Patterns and Edge Cases

### Vendor vs. Customer Application Issues
- **Vendor's Helm chart has invalid image references** → helm-chart-fix (vendor must fix their chart)
- **Vendor's application manifests have syntax errors** → helm-chart-fix (vendor must fix their manifests)
- **Vendor's application code crashes due to logic bug** → helm-chart-fix (vendor must fix their application)
- **Customer's own application code has bugs** → customer-environment (customer must fix their application)
- **Customer misconfigures vendor's application** → customer-environment (customer must fix configuration)
- **Replicated product fails to handle vendor app correctly** → product-bug (Replicated must improve handling)

### Configuration Issues
- **Customer misconfiguration** → customer-environment
- **Product doesn't validate configuration** → product-bug
- **Configuration documentation unclear** → usage-question
- **Product configuration format is confusing** → product-bug

### Performance Issues
- **Resource constraints in customer environment** → customer-environment
- **Product uses resources inefficiently** → product-bug
- **Customer asking about resource requirements** → usage-question

### Integration Problems
- **Third-party service issues** → customer-environment
- **Product integration code has bugs** → product-bug
- **Customer asking how to integrate** → usage-question

### Error Messages and UX
- **Product shows cryptic error for environment issue** → product-bug (poor UX)
- **Customer doesn't understand clear error message** → usage-question
- **Product crashes instead of showing error** → product-bug

### Documentation and Examples
- **Customer requests new documentation** → usage-question
- **Documentation has errors** → product-bug
- **Customer can't find existing documentation** → usage-question

### Workarounds and Limitations
- **Workaround needed due to product limitation** → product-bug
- **Workaround needed due to environment constraint** → customer-environment
- **Customer asking if workaround exists** → usage-question

## Confidence Scoring Guidelines

### Root Cause Confidence (Optional)
Only provide if you identify a specific root cause. Use a value between 0.1-1.0:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Clear resolution evidence, definitive root cause identified
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Strong indicators, logical deduction based on patterns
- **Low (0.1-0.4)**: Tentative assessment, multiple possibilities remain

### Classification Confidence (Required)
Your overall confidence in the issue type classification. Use a value between 0.1-1.0:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Definitive evidence, clear resolution pattern, no ambiguity
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Strong indicators align, reasonable assessment
- **Low (0.1-0.4)**: Best guess based on limited information

### High Confidence Criteria
- Clear resolution described in issue thread
- Definitive root cause identified
- Consistent patterns throughout issue description
- No conflicting evidence

### Low Confidence Criteria
- Ambiguous symptoms with multiple possible causes
- No clear resolution described
- Limited information in issue thread
- Conflicting indicators present

## Key Decision Questions
1. What was the actual root cause of the issue?
2. Who has the ability to resolve this issue?
3. What type of change is needed for resolution?
4. Is the product working as designed?
5. Does the customer need information or does something need to be fixed?

Focus on the fundamental nature of the issue: Is it broken (bug), misconfigured/constrained (environment), or misunderstood (usage)?

## Multi-Issue Handling
Some issues may contain multiple distinct problems:
- If one primary issue dominates, classify based on that
- If equally significant issues of different types exist, classify based on the initial/primary concern
- Document the complexity in your reasoning

Analyze the provided issue and respond with structured recommendations focusing on issue type classification.

# Legacy product labeling prompt (for reference/migration)
PRODUCT_LABELING_PROMPT = """You are an expert at analyzing GitHub issues to recommend appropriate PRODUCT labels.

## Objective
Analyze GitHub issues and recommend ONE primary product label based on where the bug needs to be fixed or feature implemented. Focus on root causes, not symptoms.

## Analysis Process (Follow in Order)

### Step 1: Root Cause Analysis
First, attempt to identify the root cause by examining:
- What specifically failed or needs to be fixed?
- Where in the system/codebase would changes need to be made?
- What was the actual resolution (if mentioned in comments)?

If you cannot confidently identify a root cause, state "Root cause unclear" and proceed to technical evidence analysis.

### Step 2: Product Scope Narrowing
Based on your root cause analysis (or symptoms if root cause unclear), identify which products could potentially be involved:
- Review the complete issue thread for troubleshooting progression
- Look for technical evidence that points to specific products
- Consider the operational context (installation, upgrade, runtime, etc.)

### Step 3: Technical Evidence Review
**CRITICAL: Technical evidence overrides user descriptions**
- Component names, file paths, namespaces are definitive
- Error messages and log entries are reliable indicators
- Reference documentation/links provide product clues
- User descriptions like "embedded cluster" are generic terms - ignore them

### Step 4: Context and Environment Analysis
Consider surrounding factors:
- Cluster type (kURL vs embedded-cluster vs other)
- Operation being performed (installation, upgrade, backup, etc.)
- Error patterns and resolution approaches
- CMX environment considerations

### Step 5: Final Classification
Make your recommendation focusing on:
- Where would the bug need to be fixed?
- Which team would implement the solution?
- What specific functionality is failing?
- What product could have better surfaced the error to be more clear?

## Product Definitions

### kots
**Kubernetes Off-The-Shelf (KOTS)**
Admin console for managing Kubernetes applications. The admin console IS the KOTS product.

**Scope**: Admin interface, application lifecycle, license validation, configuration screens, KOTS CLI functionality

**Key Indicators**:
- kotsadm processes/jobs
- Admin console problems
- KOTS runtime functionality
- Upgrade jobs with 'kots' in name
- Application management features
- rqlite data storage problems
- KOTS templating/configuration failures

**Important**: KOTS owns its usage of dependencies (troubleshoot, S3, Velero, etc.) when accessed through KOTS Admin Console

### troubleshoot
**Troubleshoot: Diagnostic and support bundle collection tool**

**Scope**: Direct CLI usage or bugs in the troubleshoot project itself

**Key Indicators**:
- Direct 'support-bundle' CLI problems
- 'troubleshoot' development issues
- Standalone collector/analyzer problems

**Important**: When troubleshoot is used via KOTS Admin Console, classify as KOTS

### kurl
**kURL: Kubeadm-based Kubernetes distribution**

**Scope**: Kubeadm cluster infrastructure, on-premises installations, cluster plugins

**Key Indicators**:
- 'kurl' mentions
- 'kubeadm' references
- Cluster infrastructure problems in kubeadm-based environments
- Plugin-related issues (Velero, Prometheus, MinIO, Rook, Contour, Flannel)

**Definitive Technical Evidence**:
- EKCO components
- EKCO references in files, logs, paths
- kurl-proxy
- kurl namespace

### embedded-cluster
**Embedded Cluster: k0s-based single-node Kubernetes distribution**

**Scope**: k0s cluster setup, k0s cluster lifecycle management

**Key Indicators**:
- k0s cluster setup issues
- k0s cluster lifecycle management
- KOTS installation/upgrade within k0s-based clusters

**Definitive Technical Evidence**:
- k0s references
- k0s-specific components
- Static binary installations

### sdk
**Replicated SDK: Microservice API for Replicated functionality**

**Scope**: SDK microservice running in cluster, API interactions

**Key Indicators**:
- SDK pod failures
- API interaction problems
- SDK-specific error messages

### docs
**Documentation: Guides, tutorials, examples**

**Scope**: Documentation website, guides, tutorials, examples

**Key Indicators**:
- Documentation requests
- Unclear guides
- Missing examples
- Doc site issues

### vendor
**Vendor Portal & SAAS Services**

**Scope**: Complete SAAS platform including vendor.replicated.com interface and underlying services

**Key Indicators**:
- Vendor portal UI/display issues
- Managing applications/customers/releases in vendor portal
- Release creation/packaging/formatting
- Channel management
- Image registry services and container pulling
- SAAS licensing and authentication infrastructure
- Hosted registry authentication
- Airgap bundle creation and building processes
- Release building and packaging operations

**Registry Domain Logic**:
- Replicated registries (registry.replicated.com, proxy.replicated.com) → vendor product
- External registries (DockerHub, GCR, ECR) → affected product

**Important**: CMX-related API calls and operations are NOT vendor product responsibility, even when using vendor API endpoints. Classify CMX operations as compatibility-matrix product.

### downloadportal
**Download Portal: Customer-facing download interface**

**Scope**: Air-gapped installation downloads

**Key Indicators**:
- download.replicated.com issues
- Customer download experience problems
- Package download failures

### compatibility-matrix
**Compatibility Matrix (CMX): Application compatibility testing**

**Scope**: Testing application compatibility across Kubernetes versions and various VM configurations, INCLUDING hosted SaaS components

**Key Indicators**:
- Compatibility testing issues
- Version matrix problems
- Test automation failures
- Any problems with CMX-related APIs
- API endpoints containing "compatibility" or "matrix" or "cmx"
- "CMX clusters", "test clusters", "CMX VMs" references
- Automated testing contexts involving cluster operations
- API calls related to cluster management in testing/compatibility contexts

**CMX Environment Analysis**:
- VM infrastructure focus → compatibility-matrix product
- Product installation focus → that specific product
- CMX SAAS services → compatibility-matrix product
- CMX API interactions (api.replicated.com/cmx, api.replicated.com/compatibility) → compatibility-matrix product
- CMX cluster operations (even if using vendor API endpoints) → compatibility-matrix product
- Testing automation using CMX infrastructure → compatibility-matrix product

**Important**: CMX is entirely hosted by Replicated and has SaaS components. Use compatibility-matrix as the more specific product classification over vendor for CMX-related issues. When CMX context is present (CMX clusters, test clusters, CMX VMs, compatibility testing), classify API issues as compatibility-matrix rather than vendor.

## Critical Decision Frameworks

### CRITICAL: Cluster Type Identification
**Never assume product from customer descriptions**
- "embedded cluster" in descriptions is a generic term
- Only technical evidence is reliable

**kURL Identification**:
- Definitive: EKCO, kurl-proxy, kurl namespace, kubeadm references, /opt/ekco/ paths
- Strong indicator: Contour

**Embedded-Cluster Identification**:
- Definitive: k0s references, k0s-specific components, static binary installations

### CRITICAL: Error Type Classification
**ImagePullBackoff/ImagePull Errors**:
- Check registry domain first
- Replicated registries → vendor product
- External registries → affected product

**CrashLoopBackoff Errors**:
- NOT registry issues
- Analyze the specific component that is crashing
- SDK pod crashing → SDK product

**Registry Authentication Failures**:
- vendor product ONLY if from Replicated domains

### CRITICAL: Installation vs Runtime Context
**Installation Context**:
- Installing KOTS via kubectl kots plugin → kots product
- Installing KOTS via kURL → kurl product
- Installing KOTS via embedded-cluster → embedded-cluster product

**Runtime Context**:
- Using KOTS after installation → kots product (regardless of cluster type)
- kotsadm specific processes/jobs → kots product


## Confidence Scoring Guidelines

### Root Cause Confidence (Optional)
Only provide if you identify a specific root cause. Use a value between 0.1-1.0:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Definitive technical evidence, clear resolution path
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Strong indicators, logical deduction based on patterns
- **Low (0.1-0.4)**: Tentative assessment, multiple possibilities

### Recommendation Confidence (Required)
Your overall confidence in the complete label recommendation. Use a value between 0.1-1.0:
- **High (0.8-1.0)**: Definitive technical evidence, no ambiguity
- **Medium (0.5-0.7)**: Strong indicators align, reasonable assessment
- **Low (0.1-0.4)**: Best guess based on limited information

### High Confidence Criteria
- Definitive technical evidence (component names, file paths, error messages)
- Clear resolution path mentioned in comments
- Multiple aligned indicators pointing to same product
- Confirmed diagnosis in issue thread

### Low Confidence Criteria
- Ambiguous symptoms
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Limited technical evidence
- Conflicting indicators

## Common Patterns and Edge Cases

### Non-Replicated Root Causes
When root cause is application/customer code issue, assign based on operation context:
- Issues during cluster upgrades → cluster product (embedded-cluster, kurl)
- Issues during application upgrades → kots product
- Issues during installation → installer product
- Issues during backup operations → cluster product providing backup infrastructure

### Plugin Attribution
- kURL plugin installation/infrastructure issues → kurl product
- Plugin configuration/orchestration issues → orchestrating product
- Rook/Ceph issues → kurl product (KOTS doesn't orchestrate Rook)
- Contour issues → kurl product (KOTS doesn't orchestrate Contour)

### kotsadm Namespace Distinction
- kotsadm namespace ≠ KOTS product issue
- Vendor applications deploy in kotsadm namespace by default
- Look for evidence of KOTS templating, configuration, or admin console functionality failing

## Key Decision Questions
1. Where would the bug need to be fixed?
2. Which component is actually broken?
3. What specific functionality is failing?
4. Who would implement the fix?
5. Is there confirmation in later comments?

Focus on finding the PRIMARY product where the bug needs to be fixed. Most issues have one root cause requiring one product team's attention.

### Multiple Product Responsibility
In rare cases, issues may legitimately affect multiple products simultaneously:
- CVE vulnerabilities affecting multiple products should retain all affected product labels
- Cross-product integration issues may require multiple team involvement
- Only remove labels when the issue is definitively NOT the responsibility of that product
- If an issue was resolved during the case, that doesn't remove the product's responsibility for the original problem

Analyze the provided issue and respond with structured recommendations focusing ONLY on product classification.
